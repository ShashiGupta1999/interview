# About youself?
Hi, I’m Shashi Gupta, currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at HCLTech, with over 2 years of experience in front-end development. I specialize in building scalable, performant Single Page Applications using Angular, React, and VueJS, with a strong focus on clean UI, robust functionality, and seamless API integration.

Recently, I’ve been contributing to the Report Composer (RC) project, where I joined as a new developer and quickly ramped up to independently resolve critical bugs across consuming applications like MKP, ESR, ES, and ASA. Despite tight two-week sprints and limited onboarding time, I successfully fixed all reported issues, coordinated with client teams to reproduce and understand bugs in their environments, and delivered builds ready for cloud deployment.

I actively participated in deployment meetings, gaining hands-on knowledge of the deployment lifecycle, including the importance of clear documentation and cross-team communication. I contributed to PRD, PSMP, and PSMF documentation and ensured that every release was well-documented and compliant with security standards using Snyk reports.

Throughout my journey, I’ve led and contributed to several impactful poc's:

In the Airline Management System, I implemented full CRUD functionality with validation logic to prevent duplicate entries, enhancing data integrity and user experience.
In the Transaction SPA, I ensured a smooth user interface and integrated unit testing using Jasmine and Karma, which significantly improved code reliability and maintainability.
For the Food Order App, I developed both customer and admin modules, enabling real-time item management and vendor operations—this helped simulate a real-world food delivery platform.

These projects not only strengthened my technical foundation but also taught me how to deliver business value—whether it’s improving performance, reducing bugs, or enhancing usability. I’ve also contributed as an SDET, with hands-on experience in REST API testing and Linux, which helps me collaborate effectively across the full stack.

I believe I’m a strong fit for this role because I combine technical depth with a proactive mindset. I’m always eager to learn, adapt, and contribute to high-performing teams. My experience in delivering end-to-end solutions, along with my passion for clean, user-centric design, aligns perfectly with the expectations of a Senior UI Developer role.

# “Can you walk me through your most recent role and key responsibilities?”

"In my current role as a Senior Software Engineer at HCLTech, I’ve been working on the Report Composer (RC) project since March 2025. RC is a web-based reporting and scheduling system built using ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Razor views, and JSON APIs. It supports job scheduling, report management, and user administration, with automated testing using xUnit and Moq for reliability.

The backend is built on .NET Framework 4.8 and 3.5, with shared libraries using .NET Standard 2.0 for cross-platform compatibility. The frontend uses Razor (.cshtml), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. Development and deployment are managed using Visual Studio, SSMS, IIS, and VS Code.

Despite being new to the RC module, I quickly took ownership of bug fixes and enhancements across consuming applications like MKP, ESR, ES, and ASA. I worked in tight two-week sprint cycles and consistently delivered production-ready builds for cloud deployment. I collaborated directly with client teams to understand and reproduce bugs in their environments, which helped me resolve issues more effectively.

Some of the key bugs I resolved include:

Locale-specific issues across 13 supported languages including UK English, German, French (France & Canada), Spanish (Spain & Latin America), Italian, Finnish, Traditional Chinese, Portuguese (Portugal & Brazil), Dutch, Swedish, and Greek.
Language pack rendering issues, especially for Greek and French, ensuring proper UI translation and formatting.
Zoom-related UI bugs affecting accessibility and responsiveness.
Pagination and search filter bugs that impacted data navigation and user experience.
I also participated in deployment meetings, gaining hands-on experience with the deployment lifecycle. These sessions emphasized the importance of clear documentation and cross-team communication. I contributed to PRD, PSMP, and PSMF documentation, ensuring that every release was well-documented and aligned with business and technical requirements.

Additionally, I generated and analyzed Snyk security reports to ensure our applications were compliant and free from vulnerabilities. This proactive approach helped maintain the integrity and security of the product.

Overall, my role in RC demonstrated my ability to quickly adapt, take ownership under pressure, and deliver high-impact solutions. I believe these qualities—combined with my strong front-end and backend understanding—make me a strong fit for this UI Role

# “What motivated you to apply for this position?”


"I’m excited to apply for the Senior UI Developer role at Recruit CRM because it aligns perfectly with both my technical strengths and my passion for building intuitive, high-performance user interfaces.

I’m excited about the possibility of working in a collaborative, agile environment where I can contribute not just as a developer, but as a problem-solver and product thinker. This transition feels like the right step to continue growing, learning, and delivering meaningful value."

# “How can we justify a 12 LPA package when our standard hike is 30%?”

"I completely understand the standard hike policy, and I appreciate the transparency. However, I believe a 12 LPA package is a fair reflection of the value I bring, especially considering the scope and depth of my current responsibilities.

I’ve grown significantly beyond my current compensation level of 6.25 LPA. In my current role, I’m not just contributing as a developer—I’m independently handling bug fixes, collaborating with client teams, participating in deployment meetings, and supporting localization across 13 languages. These are responsibilities typically expected from someone at a senior level.

I’ve worked on full-stack modules like Report Composer, involving ASP.NET MVC, C#, Razor views, Entity Framework, and JSON APIs. I’ve resolved complex bugs like language pack issues, zoom-related UI problems, pagination, and search filter bugs—all within tight sprint cycles.

I’ve demonstrated ownership and adaptability, joining a new module and delivering production-ready builds under pressure. I’ve also contributed to documentation (PRD, PSMP, PSMF) and gained deployment experience, which adds to my cross-functional value.

The market value for a Senior UI Developer with my skill set—Angular, React, VueJS, .NET, localization, testing, and deployment experience—is closer to 10–12 LPA, especially in product-based companies. I’m confident that I can deliver at that level from day one.

So while I respect the policy, I hope you’ll consider the broader picture—my current contributions, proven capabilities, and the immediate value I can bring to Recruit CRM. I’m looking for a role that matches both my skills and my growth trajectory, and I believe this package reflects that alignment."

# “What factors are most important to you in your compensation package?”

Fair Market Value:
I’m looking for a package that reflects my experience and the value I bring—especially considering my current responsibilities in full-stack development, localization across 13 languages, and ownership of deployment-ready builds. Based on market standards, I believe a package in the range of 10–12 LPA is appropriate.

Growth Opportunities:
I value roles where I can continue to learn and grow—whether through challenging projects, mentorship, or exposure to new technologies. A compensation package that supports professional development (like training budgets or certifications) is a big plus.
